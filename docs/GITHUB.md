Github Setup
===========

In this document, we will go over how to set up Github in order to be able to contribute to our projects.

Github Account Creation
------------
The first thing you'll need to do is create a Github account. In this tutorial, we will show you how to create an account using your jagmail, although you are welcome to use a different email account if you wish.

1. Visit [github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup)
2. Follow the prompts and fill out the proper information, using your jagmail (or other valid email address) when asked.

5. You should now be brought to a dashboard. If you've reached this step, then you have successfully created your Github account!

Github Desktop Installation
------------
For those who are new to Github, you may want to consider installing Github Desktop. This is an application that essentially allows you to use Github in a more user-friendly manner. Although this program is not required in order to use Github, it certainly makes life a lot easier.

1. Visit [desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com)
2. Download the software based on your operating system (this tutorial is done in Windows)

3. Run the .exe file that is installed.
4. Press the blue button labeled `Sign in to GitHub.com`

5. You should be taken to the sign-in page on your browser. Login to your account and grant Github Desktop any permissions it may ask for.
6. You may be prompted to modify your Git identity. For simplicity sake, just select `Use my Github account name and email address.`

7. That's it! You should now be brought to a home panel. If you've reached this step, then you've successfully downloaded and set up Github Desktop!
