Contributing
===========

Welcome to the Campus Rush contributing guide! We're exciting to have you participate in the creation of our game, so to make sure you understand how to contribute, let's go over what you'll need to do.

Cloning the Repository
------------
In order to start modifying the game, first you need to clone the project repository. For this tutorial, we will assume you have Github Desktop installed; if you haven't downloaded it already, you can check out our [`GITHUB.md`](docs/GITHUB.md) document to learn how!

1. Open Github Desktop
2. If this is your first time cloning a repository, you can press the `Clone a repository from the Internet` button. Otherwise, you can just go to `File > Clone repository` in the top-left corner (they both take you to the same place).

3. Select the URL tab, copy-paste `https://github.com/USA-Video-Game-Development-Club/VGDC-CampusRush.git` into the prompt, and press the blue Clone button.

4. You should now see a panel similar to the one in the image below. If so, then you have successfully cloned the repository!

Open Project in Unity
------------
Now that you've cloned the repository files, you can load the project into Unity and start making changes. If you haven't already downloaded Unity Hub, you can check out our [`UNITY.md`](docs/UNITY.md) document to learn how!

1. Open Unity Hub
2. In the top-right corner, click on the button labeled `Open`.

3. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository files. The last directory you open should be the `CampusRush` directory; you'll know you've done this step correctly if it attempts to load the project.
4. You will most likely get a warning message about a missing editor version. This is because we need to download a certain version of the Unity editor in order for the project to compile. Make sure version `2021.3.8f1` is selected, and proceed to install it. You do not need to select any additional platforms to download.

5. Once the download is finished, you should be able to click on the project to open it (assuming it doesn't automatically open). This will open the Unity editor and allow you to make changes to the game!
